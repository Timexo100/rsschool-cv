    if (pExp.length === 3) {
      if (this.roman.includes(a) && this.roman.includes(b)) {
        let aCon = this.converter.romanToArab(a);
        let bCon = this.converter.romanToArab(b);
        let result = this.make(operator, aCon, bCon);
        return result > 0 ? this.converter.arabToRoman(result) : "";
      } else {
        return this.make(operator, a, b) + "";
